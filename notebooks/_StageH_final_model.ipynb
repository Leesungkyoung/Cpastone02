    "본 연구에서는 모델의 재현 성능 한계를 극복하고 불량 탐지의 실효성을 확보하기 위해, Stage H~I 구간에서 불균형 처리 기법, 하이퍼파라미터 최적화, 및 임계값(Threshold) 최적화를 포함한 고급 모델링 프로세스를 수행하였다. 먼저 Stage H에서는 여러 불균형 처리 기법을 비교한 결과, 단순 SMOTE 또는 ADASYN 대비 SMOTE-ENN 조합이 가장 안정적으로 Recall과 PR-AUC 성능을 향상시키는 것으로 나타났다. 이 기법은 소수 클래스(불량)의 특성을 보존하면서도 불량과 유사한 노이즈 샘플을 제거하여 학습 안정성을 크게 개선하였다.\n",
    "\n",
    "이후 Stage H의 최적 샘플링 조합(핵심 피처 + 파생 피처 기반 데이터)에 대해 **Optuna 최적화(50 Trials)**를 수행한 결과, LightGBM 기반 모델의 핵심 파라미터(learning rate, num_leaves, depth 등)가 정교하게 조정되면서 모델의 분류 경계가 개선되었고 Test 세트 기준 PR-AUC·Recall·Balanced Accuracy가 초기 Stage 대비 유의미하게 상승하였다. 특히 소수 클래스의 탐지율(Recall)이 개선되면서 생산 공정에서 중요한 조기 불량 감지 가능성이 확보되었다는 점에 큰 의의가 있다.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage K에서는 모델의 확률 출력값을 기반으로 PR-curve 기반 Best-F1 Threshold를 산출하여 기본 0.5 임계값의 한계를 보완하였다. 이를 통해 기본 Threshold에서 발생하던 과도한 FN(불량 미탐지)을 효과적으로 줄이고, 기존 대비 더 균형 잡힌 Precision–Recall trade-off를 확보하였다. 실제 Best-F1 Threshold 적용 결과, 기본 임계값 대비 Recall·Balanced Accuracy·F1 Score가 개선되어, 운영 관점에서도 더 안정적인 불량 탐지 모델을 구축할 수 있었다.\n",
    "\n",
    "마지막으로 Stage I에서는 최종 모델을 배포 가능한 형태로 고정(Freeze)하기 위해 학습된 모델, 입력 스케일러, 최종 Threshold를 각각 저장하였다. 이를 통해 추후 관제 시스템 또는 실시간 대시보드 환경에서 동일한 입력 데이터를 그대로 처리하고 일관된 예측 값을 제공할 수 있도록 재사용성과 확장성을 확보하였다.\n",
    "\n",
    "종합하면, Stage H~I의 모델 개선 과정은 단순한 성능 향상을 넘어 실제 공정 현장에서 요구되는 불량 탐지 안정성, 임계값 조정 유연성, 운영·배포 가능성을 갖춘 최종 모델을 완성하는 단계로 기능하였다. 본 모델은 이후의 ROI 기반 Threshold 보정, 운영환경 튜닝, 실시간 알람 시스템 연계 등 다양한 실무 적용 시나리오에도 즉시 활용 가능하다.\n",
